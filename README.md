## Bernoulli Framework
>There is no philosophy which is not founded upon knowledge of the phenomena, but to get any profit from this knowledge it is absolutely necessary to be a mathematician. - Daniel Bernoulli


In this framework every function has two outcome as in the bernoulli principle. Either they are executed or not. It's your job as implementer to handle the non-execution :)

### Features: 
- Functions can be defined
- Functions will be exeecuted 50% of the time
